# CalevaLab-HAMK
ICT-project

The project objective was to create a base for an Athlete Management System mobile application for our client CalevaLab, where athletes can see and track their activity data from multiple different fitness trackers. The app is also for the athlete’s coach to monitor the athlete’s activity data and to better manage the athlete’s training, progress, and recovery.

The main idea behind the project was not only to create a mobile application but to also research how data can be gathered from third-party fitness trackers, what is the logic behind data collection and storing, the apps logical flow, and how the data can then be integrated into the software and displayed effectively. The work load was about 50% on the research and planning side and 50% on the actual practical programming of the application.

The outcome was that we developed a mobile application where the athlete can see their slept hours, steps and burned calories daily for past 7 days, the weekly average for past 7 weeks and the monthly average for past 7 months. Athlete can also edit their profile and decide the priority from which fitness tracker the activity data is collected from. Athlete also has a Athlete CV or Athlete card, which includes all of the data about his or hers activity, which can then be shared to a coach for updates on the athletes activity.
